### WARNING

This is a work-in-progress! It does *not* fully work. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

## To Do

* Custom state flowing through decision tree
* Response body encoding (e.g. gzip, deflate)
* Response charsets
* Better example(s)
* Docs
* Tracing support (return a header w/ the nodes we visited?)
* Graceful shutdown in example?

### State monad for response data (headers, code, anything else?)

* How to handle polymorphism of state? Existencial types + wwrapper type?
* Where to store trace data?
